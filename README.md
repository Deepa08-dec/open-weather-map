To develop your virtual assistant, you’ll need to integrate different components:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   
Use Python’s speech_recognition (for voice input) and gTTS (for voice output).
Alternatively, use OpenAI’s GPT API for text-based interactions.

2. Reminder System

Use Python’s schedule or APScheduler to handle reminders.

Store reminders in a database (SQLite or JSON) for persistence.

3. Weather Information

Integrate with a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather update

4. Basic Question Answering

Use OpenAI's GPT API or Wolfram Alpha API for answering general questions

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Flask or FastAPI (if you want a web-based assistant)

Database: SQLite or Firebase (for storing reminders)

APIs: OpenWeatherMap, Wolfram Alpha, GPT API
